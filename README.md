# Allianz Homework
Hello everyone,


This is the repository of the Allianz-homework.

Techs and Tools:

The h2 database is considered as an in-memory database, the appropriate data like URL, driverClassName... have been defined in the "application.properties" file.

The project has been developed by using the spring boot java framework, maven dependencies...

IntelliJ has been considered as the IDE. 

All the usernames and passwords have been defined on the SecurityConfig.java

The step-by-step howTo is stored on the following youtube link:

I hope it could meet the demanded requirements.


Sincerely

Alireza Zamani
